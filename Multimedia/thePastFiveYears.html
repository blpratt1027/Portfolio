                        Timothy Berners-Lee proposed and implemented the system that became the World Wide Web in 1989 to facilitate 
                        communication between researchers. He also designed the first Web browser. The first website was put up at 
                        CERN in France on 6 August 1991. It gave information on creating webpages and about the use of hypertext 
                        <a class="plainText" href="#worksCited1">(Wikipedia, 2013)</a>. Since then there have been many developments 
                        that have influenced the practice of web design.

                        The invention of tables led to the development of table based page layout, something that tables were never 
                        intended for and which still causes controversy today. Still the use of tables caught on with a vengeance 
                        because it opened up the possibility of designing the visual structure of a page.  There are still many 
                        web pages based on tables and designers who feel that for some purposes tables still have their use 
                        <a class="plainText" href="#worksCited1">(Budd, 2004)</a>. The people on the other side of the fence point 
                        to the fact that the same effect can be accomplished with CSS, with the advantages of much smaller code and 
                        the ability to change the appearance of all the pages on a website in a uniform manner by merely changing the 
                        code in a single CSS file <a class="plainText" href="#worksCited1">(Keith, 2003)</a>.

                        Shockwave and Flash are two competing technologies developed for showing movies and animation on the Web. 
                        Shockwave has a much faster rendering engine than Flash but has no plugin available for Linux or Solaris and 
                        has come to be most used in game development <a class="plainText" href="#worksCited1">(Wikipedia, 2013)</a>. 
                        Flash has good compatibility across browsers but has the disadvantage of requiring the installation of the 
                        Flash player. Flash also creates difficulties with SEO and accessibility with mobile devices such as iPhone 
                        and Blackberry <a class="plainText" href="#worksCited1">(New Jersey web design agency, 2013)</a>.

                        3DML is a language that was invented in 1996 by Michael Powers. Used for 3-D websites and with a non-valid XML, 
                        it requires a plugin for IE, Netscape Navigator, the AOL browser, and Opera. Development stopped in 2005 and there

                        In the past five years the growth of the online retailing sector of e-commerce has increased the need for 
                        interactive database driven websites to track and display merchants' goods and to take the customers orders.  
                        Small and medium sized enterprises have also increased their use of the Internet to order goods and services 
                        from other businesses and to make payments. This leads to the need to design websites that facilitates and 
                        automates these business to business interactions <a class="plainText" href="#worksCited2">(Commission, 2011)</a>.

                        The expansion of the Internet into the field of education in the past few years has provided a large new market 
                        for the services of web designers who are needed to design new interactive  websites  such as the Canvas website 
                        used at Bellevue College to coordinate the online learning courses of the school. The need for adult career 
                        retraining has helped to spur the growth in online enrollments and 69 percent of academic leaders think student 
                        demand for online courses is growing and most believe their online enrollments will increase in the coming year(2007)

                        While there will be a greater need for the design of more complex websites predesigned solutions are gaining ground 
                        in the field of small site design. With WordPress it was possible for anyone to design their own site. Although this 
                        was possible it turned out that many people didn't want to be their own website designer. They turned to the free 
                        themes available for WordPress. This didn't make the designers any money but they used free themes to draw customers 
                        to their websites and made their money by selling to customers who had special needs and were willing to pay for 
                        custom themes <a class="plainText" href="#worksCited2">(Turnbull, 2011)</a>.

                        The growth of the online retailing sector of e-commerce has increased in many fields and consumer satisfaction is 
                        greater with online retailors than with the traditional bricks and mortar stores. (Dusto, 2013) The trends toward 
                        progressive enhancement, responsive design, native support for plug-in features, the increased use of apps and the 
                        explosion of devices used, all point to a sea change in web design and development. To meet the demands of their 
                        online retailers, developers and designers will have to embrace the new standards and technologies so the websites 
                        will display properly on the new tablets and mobile devices, and they won't lose customers who increasingly try to 
                        access them from these devices <a class="plainText" href="#worksCited3">(Grannell, 2012).</a>

                        online students demand. Microsoft's website lists 32 Microsoft approved partners who can provide the expertise to 
                        build these systems <a class="plainText" href="#worksCited3">(Microsoft, 2013)</a>. This is just the tip of the

                        Since WordPress was released in 2003 it has been downloaded over 65 million times. The free, open source blogging

                        In the late 1950s the Internet began as a file sharing system to allow U.S. Government researchers to share files. 
                        Originally patterned after the academic model of typewritten pages it was not until the introduction of Mosaic with 
                        the use of hypertext and hyperlinks that the website model was born. Websites are classified by the type of content 
                        they contain and generating content is an important part of the work of building a website 
                        <a class="plainText" href="#worksCited3">(Wikipedia, 2013 )</a>.

                    <p>
                        The challenge of providing content varies with the type of website. But the first rule must be that the content must 
                        be relevant to the purpose of the website. There are many ways of generating content. One way is a blog. Blogs short 
                        for web log, may be the output of one individual or may solicit questions or comments from visitors. Some websites 
                        solicit short articles from writers whos reward is a link back to his own web page. Much content is the result of 
                        paid writers. The written word is not the only type of content. Content may consist of video, audio and images. You 
                        tube is a huge website consisting of video clips ranging from short user produced instructional videos to complete 
                        movies. Many musicians have their own websites which promote and sell their own art. The same in true for visual artists.
