                    <p>
                        Development for the Internet is evolving at a breathtakingly rapid pace.  The greatest risk facing web developers is 
                        not keeping their skills up to date and becoming obsolete.  This is something that can happen, literally, in a matter 
                        of months, unlike other industries, where obsolescence generally occurs over a period of years.
                    </p>

                    <p>Here are a just a few of many trends to keep an eye on:</p>

                    <h4>Increased adherence to standards</h4>
                    <p>
                        Lax adherence to development standards has been rampant in web development for years.  The demand for a common, well 
                        adhered-to set of standards has been a major driving force behind the development of the HTML5 and CSS3 standards.  
                        Increasingly, newer versions of browsers will drop support for older versions of HTML, and old and/or poorly written 
                        sites will break.
                    </p>

                    <h4>HTML5</h4>
                    <p>
                        The new W3C HTML standard, HTML5, though not yet complete, is already having a major impact on web development , and 
                        most of  its features are supported by the newest generations of browsers.  HTML5 breaks new ground in a number of ways:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Robust support of multimedia, eliminating or greatly reducing dependency on “helper apps.” </li>
                        <li>Increased browser-based off-line storage, meaning that data is stored on the client rather than the server.</li>
                        <li>Integration of MathML and SVG elements for including math formulas, creating geometric shapes, etc.</li>
                        <li>New elements to simply structure, such as navigation sections, headers, footers, etc.</li>
                        <li>And many, many others…</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Taken together, the new features of HTML5 significant change and simplify the way that web sites are developed and formatted, 
                        and how multimedia is handled and stored.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Ever increasing use of mobile devices</h4>
                    <p>
                        The amount of Internet content being accessed via mobile devices has skyrocketed in the past few years, and the trend 
                        continues at an ever accelerating pace.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While developing a version of a website specifically for mobile devices, or at least a site that is at least usable on 
                        a much smaller display was once optional, it is now essential.  The diversity in standardization among mobile devices 
                        significantly increases the difficulty of developing web content for them, it is something that every web developer 
                        and designer will have to know how to do.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Increasing use of web platforms</h4>
                    <p>
                        A significant percentage of new websites are being developed using web platforms, such as WordPress.  Fluency in the 
                        use of these technologies will be critical for developers and designers.

                        I believe design will be more closely influenced by the Web, as designers try to make their designs more intuitive.  
                        Art-directed designs will be used primarily by designers creating portfolio websites, and will not be commonly used for 
                        corporate sites due to the complexity in the coding and since they usually require inline styling opposed to one main style 
                        sheet for the entire site.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Table based websites will become obsolete whereas sites will become more interactive and responsive such as sites implementing 
                        “key-press navigation.” The most popular setting for such navigating is found on the photo websites Flickr and FFFFound. 
                        At FFFFound you are offered shortcuts to jump to the top of the page by pressing “h,” change your view by pressing “v,” 
                        while “k” and “j” are used for browsing through images. Key-press navigation is common in Flash-based designs but can be 
                        applied in CSS-based designs as well.

                    <p>Excerpt from:http://www.forbes.com/sites/ericjackson/2012/04/30/heres-why-google-and-facebook-might-completely-disappear-in-the-next-5-years/</p>
                    <p>In the Internet world, we've really had 3 generations:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Web 1.0 (companies founded from 1994 – 2001, including Netscape, Yahoo! (YHOO), AOL (AOL),Google (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN) and eBay(EBAY))</li>
                        <li>Web 2.0 or Social (companies founded from 2002 – 2009, including Facebook (FB), LinkedIn (LNKD), and Groupon (GRPN))</li>
                        <li>And now Mobile (from 2010 – present, including Instagram).</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        This new generation of mobile applications has proven to be the most influential and growing market to date. With a mobile 
                        application most websites will become unnecessary to view since the client is able to make a few touches to their I-phone or 
                        Android device and can view the same or more information in a quicker format than by viewing the actual website. In my opinion 
                        design will become even more simplified in the mobile generation due to the demand of smaller file downloads with maximized 
                        usability. Websites will still have a need for the intuitive design aspects but will be more simplified as they will need their 
                        site to closely resemble their mobile applications. This is one complication that Google and Facebook have both run into and the 
                        belief is that they will not be widely used in the next five to eight years. Facebook is still one of the most popular sites 
                        today but has a huge competitor with Instagram being a primarily mobile application. Instagram was so simple that the website 
                        it uses does not have any features which are not available on the mobile application, which is not true for Facebook. This is 
                        the main reason why I believe mobile applications are the future of multimedia design.
