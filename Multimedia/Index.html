                Our sector is all about creating a web presence.  From front end design and user interface needs, to the back end dealing 
                with developers coding software for specific industries.  We make sure your website looks great, creates content worth 
                interacting with, it easy to navigate and uses code that generates traffic and value.

                        Since the first website was put up in 1991 the Web has grown at a frantic pace. From a strictly text based 
                        interface the Web has become increasingly visual. Starting with the invention of tables through the development 
                        of CSS, Shockwave, Flash, Dynamic HTML, the document object model and scripts the technology has enabled 
                        website designers to create more visual websites.

                    <p>
                        All these developments have encouraged the use of the Web in the fields of large and small business, education 
                        and personal communication.

                        Changes in Web technology and the explosive growth of the World Wide Web have created a demand for 
                        more complex and universal coding.  The constant upgrade in Web technology demands more proficient

                        Almost every business today uses the Web to facilitate business to business interactions.  Schools 
                        use the Web to interact with their students, and online classes and career training are in ever 
                        increasing demand. In the fairly recent past, there were few websites, containing only material 
                        relevant to one or two subjects or ideas.  Today there are millions.

                        With the rapid evolution of the Web and everything related to it, there is always going to be something 
                        new. This means new rules and an increased demand for adherence to new standards for HTML5 and CSS3, 
                        and development for smart phones and other mobile devices. The more complex the Web becomes the more 
                        Web design/development and user interface design will change.

        <h2>About this Site...</h2>
        <p>This site was a group project from my first quarter in the Web Development program at
            Bellevue College, Winter Quarter, 2013.  The five of us on the team contributed content, but
            I designed and wrote the code for the site entirely on my own.</p>
        <p>At the time, I had less than one  month of experience with CSS.  I have included this project because I am
            quite proud of how quickly I was able to learn CSS and use it to create something that I think is quite
            presentable.</p>
