Bryan Pratt's Portfolio

In December, 2012, I decided that I wanted to get serious about programming.  I decided that I was most interested in Web development.  Up to that point, I had some limited experience with Visual Basic 3.0, HTML 1, VBA, and DOS batch files.  

I began classes at Bellevue College (Bellevue, WA) in January, 2013, and began studying HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, C#, and T-SQL.

This portfolio is a representation of what I have learned in a period of 18 months.

My portfolio is on-line at http://blpratt1027.byethost10.com/.
