        <h3>Bikers Against Child Abuse</h3>
        <p class="small">Posted May 21, 2014</p>
        <p>Happy Dodson and Taz Roman are bikers. Not cyclists, but the leather jacket and chained wallet kind of
            bikers. They're also members of a group called Bikers Against Child Abuse.</p>
        <p>The nonprofit, with chapters across the U.S. and in some parts of Europe, accepts referrals from parents,
            guardians, police, social workers and other agencies. Whenever those kids don't feel safe, they can call
            Happy, Taz and their other biker friends, who come straight to the child's house.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;You got 15, 20 bikes rolling down the street, and everybody&rsquo;s in leather,&rdquo; Happy tells Taz
            on a visit to StoryCorps in Norwich, Conn. &ldquo;You know, everybody works, and everybody's got everything
            else going on, but we drop all that stuff for that kid.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>The group's sometimes fierce look can help bolster the kids, explains Taz, 29. &ldquo;You know, kids
            understand that we're scarier than the person that's abusing them.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Then they realize that, &lsquo;Hey, there are adults that we can trust and will take care of us,
            &rsquo; &rdquo; Happy says. &ldquo;There's just no way to describe the feeling. And normally I'm not a soft
            person!&rdquo;</p>

        <p>The handmade replica means a lot to North Bend resident Bill Walker.</p>
        <p>Walker, 90, was 21 years old when he walked the decks and worked the boiler rooms of the USS Cabot during
            World War II.</p>
        <p>Seventy years later, he wanted to remember his experience with a 12-inch model kit of the Independence-class
            ship. But his failing eyesight made it a challenge. So, at a dinner party, friend and neighbor Bob Malone
            volunteered to build it.</p>

        <h3>Cynical? You May Be Hurting Your Brain Health</h3>
        <p class="small">Posted May 30, 2014</p>
        <p>People with high levels of cynical distrust may be more likely to develop dementia, according to a study
            published in the May 28, 2014, online issue of <em>Neurology</em><sup>&reg;</sup>, the medical journal of the
            American Academy of Neurology.</p>
        <p>Cynical distrust, which is defined as the belief that others are mainly motivated by selfish concerns, has
            been associated with other health problems, such as heart disease. This is the first study to look at the
            relationship between cynicism and dementia.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;These results add to the evidence that people’s view on life and personality may have an impact on their
            health,” said study author Anna-Maija Tolppanen, PhD, of the University of Eastern Finland in Kuopio.
            “Understanding how a personality trait like cynicism affects risk for dementia might provide us with
            important insights on how to reduce risks for dementia.&rdquo;</p>

    <h2>Life After &lsquo;Life&rsquo;: Aging Inmates Struggle For Redemption</h2>
    <div>
        <h3>&ldquo;You want that person to suffer? Let them change.&rdquo;</h3>
        <p class="small">Posted June 5, 2014</p>
        <p>Most of the men here spent about three decades in prison, three decades in the same room. But there's no
            self-pity here, mostly because of Red Thorpe, a former inmate.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;It's hard for us to talk about it out loud,&rdquo; Thorpe says. &ldquo;Somewhere along the line, we
            feel sorry for what we've done.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>Thorpe's the leader. This program was modeled after him. After 25 years in prison, he went from motel
            handyman to college instructor and managed to do it largely on his own. Now he mentors everyone who comes
            through the Dahlia halfway house.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;We feel bad because of the pain and suffering we've inflicted upon others,&rdquo; he tells the group
            during one of their meetings. &ldquo;Until you come to grips with that, the rest of you is a
            fa&ccedil;ade.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>Thorpe recently earned his Ph.D. He spends his days teaching young adults who are struggling. In recent
            years, he has helped more than 400 of them get their GEDs. He's raised his wife's children as his own into
            successful young adults who call him Dad.</p>
        <p>But like everyone else in the program, Thorpe has a past. And it will change the way you see him.</p>
